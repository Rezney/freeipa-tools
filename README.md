ipa-tools
=========

My personal set of tools for FreeIPA upstream development. Simply clone the
git tree and add it to your $PATH to use the scripts.

You will need to enter your Fedora credentials to patchtotrac.py to make
uploading patches to Trac working and your upstream user name in sendpatch.py.
